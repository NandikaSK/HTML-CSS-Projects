<h1>HTML-CSS-Projects</h1>
A collection of beginner-friendly HTML and CSS projects that I’m working on to understand front-end development better. These projects come from Coddy Tech challenges and YouTube tutorials.

Project Details:
1. Solar Eclipse Annimation:
   - We made a circle and called it the “moon.”
   - We colored the moon using a dark blue gradient to make it look like space.
   - Then we added a secret extra circle behind it using ::before. This extra circle helps the moon look like it is glowing, moving, and changing shape during the eclipse.
   - The moon moves up, down, left, right, and grows a little using an animation.
   - The animation also makes the moon shine brighter in the middle, just like when the Sun glows during an eclipse.
   - The background of the page is a dark night sky made with a gradient.
   - We used flexbox to keep the moon perfectly at the center of the screen.
   - We also added a media query so that on small screens (like a phone), the moon becomes smaller and still fits nicely.
